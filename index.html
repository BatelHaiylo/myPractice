    <ol><b><em>Documentaries</em></b>
        <p>In 2009, the feature-length documentary The September Issue was released;<br> it was an inside view of the production of the record-breaking September 2007 issue of U.S. Vogue,<wbr>directed by R. J. Cutler.<br>
            The film was shot over eight months as Wintour prepared the issue,<wbr> and included testy exchanges between Wintour and her creative director Grace Coddington.<br>The issue became the largest ever published at the time;<wbr>
            over 5 pounds in weight and 840 pages in length,<wbr> a world record for a monthly magazine Since then,<wbr> that record has been broken by Vogue's 2012 September issue,<wbr> which came in at 916 pages.<br>
            Also in 2012, HBO released a documentary entitled In Vogue:<br>The Editor's Eye, in conjunction with the 120th anniversary of the magazine.<br>
            Drawing on Vogue's extensive archives, the film featured behind-the-scenes interviews with longtime Vogue editors,<wbr> including Wintour, Coddington, Tonne Goodman, Babs Simpson, Hamish Bowles, and Phyllis Posnick.<br>
            Celebrated subjects and designers in the fashion industry, such as <wbr>Nicole Kidman, Sarah Jessica Parker, Linda Evangelista, Vera Wang, and Marc Jacobs, also appear in the film.<br>
            The editors share personal stories about collaborating with top photographers,<wbr>
            such as Leibovitz, and the various day-to-day responsibilities and interactions of a fashion editor at Vogue.<br>The film was directed and produced by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato.<br>
            In October 2012, Vogue also released a book titled Vogue:<wbr>The Editor's Eye to complement the documentary.
        </p>

    <ol><b><em>Video channel</em></b>
        <p>
            In 2013, Vogue launched the Vogue video channel that can be accessed via their website.<br>

    <ol><b><em>Voguepedia</em></b>
        <p>
            Launched in 2011 by Condé Nast Digital, Voguepedia is a fashion encyclopedia that also includes an archive of every issue of Vogue's American edition since 1892.<br> Only Vogue staff are permitted to contribute to the encyclopedia, unlike the VogueEncyclo—hosted by Vogue Italia—that receives contributions from anyone.<br>
             As of May 9, 2013, the site was not fully functional; code still showed in search results and only certain search terms yielded results.
        </p>
    </ol>
    <ol><b><em>Website</em></b>
        <p>
            Vogue has also created an easily navigable website that includes six different content categories for viewers to explore. The website includes an archive with issues from 1892 forward for those whom subscribe for the website. The magazines online are the same as those that were printed in that time and are not cut or shortened from the original content.
        </p>
    </ol>
    <ol><b><em>Podcast</em></b>
        <p>
            Vogue launched the teaser for its podcast series on September 10, 2015.<br>
            The magazine announced that star André Leon Talley would host the podcasts,<wbr> and the inaugural twenty-one-minute podcast was released on September 14, 2015, featuring Anna Wintour.<br>
            Talley commented that he had "been a longtime storyteller at Vogue and it's just another format for telling stories—as at Vogue, we love to tell the story of style, fashion, and what is absolutely a part of the culture at the moment", hence why the magazine has decided to create podcasts.
        </p>
    </ol>
    <ol><b><em>Vogue App</em></b>
        <p>
            The app was introduced on April 26, 2016, as a way for the magazine to become more mobile friendly. The Vogue app displays content on mobile devices and gives people the ability to view the magazine content wherever they go. The app has new content every day and people can choose to receive content recommended just for their taste.<br>
             In addition, the app allows one to save stories for later and or read offline.<wbr> Lastly, the app provides notifications for fashion outbreaks and for new stories that are published pertaining to that viewer's particular taste.
        </p>
    </ol>
    <ol><b><em>Vogue Business</em></b>
        <p>
            The online fashion industry publication was launched in January 2019. The new property aims at offering a global perspective on the fashion industry with industry insights.<br>
            Although sharing the Vogue brand name,<wbr> Vogue Business is operated as a separate business entity with an independent editorial team.<br>
            In June 2019, Vogue Business launched the Vogue Business Talent, a platform that promotes vacancies<wbr> from international fashion brands and companies with the goal to match professionals with their job opportunities.
